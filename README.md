# JoyStick
This App allows you to keep track of your video games and consoles.

First Sign up for an account.
Then create a new Collection. Every collection can only have one console, but infinite games!
You can pick from a list of consoles / games (if you seed the database) or add your own!

## Usage
To use this app, just clone, run 'rake db:migrate', run 'rake db:seed' and then run 'shotgun'. Everything should be set up!
